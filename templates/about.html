      <h2><span class="text-warning">How</span> It Works</h2>
      <p>Our tool isn't a crystal ball, but it's the next best thing. We've trained a sophisticated machine learning model on thousands of anonymized data points from real-world insurance cases.</p>
      <p>The model learns the complex patterns between key life factors and the final premium cost. When you enter your details, our system compares your profile to these learned patterns to generate a highly-educated estimate.</p>
      <p>This gives you a powerful, data-driven starting point for your financial planning.</p>

      <h3>Key Prediction Factors</h3>
      <p>Our model considers the most significant factors that insurers use:</p>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Age:</strong> A primary factor in premium calculation.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>BMI (Body Mass Index):</strong> An indicator of health status.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Smoker Status:</strong> A strong predictor of higher costs.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Number of Children:</strong> Can affect family plan costs.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Region:</strong> Location-based differences in healthcare costs.</li>
